The MoJ Design System is a collaboration between the community of users and the design system team. Anyone can get involved to help improve and grow the design system by:

Anyone can get involved to help improve and grow the design system by:

- adding new components
- providing feedback on components and patterns
- getting involved in the community discussions

Get involved and help shape the experience of using the design system for your colleagues throughout the MoJ.

### Adding new components

All new components submitted to the design system must include specific information before being published.

#### Minimum criteria for adding a new component to the design system
When adding a new component, you need to include information explaining:

- the overview of the component
- why the component is needed
- current uses for the component
- when not to use the component

#### Criteria for a "complete" component

If you also have the following information and assets available, this helps bring the component to a more complete state:

- HTML/Nunjucks code
- accessibility tested to WCAG 2.2
- the component design is available in the MoJ Figma kit
- full documentation to support all aspects of the component

#### After submitting the new component

It will be available to view immediately in the design system. All new components added by community users are tagged as "<strong>community components</strong>".

This means they're only intended for use in the alpha and beta phases of the project as it is not yet fully integrated into the design system. This is because some key bits of information for the component have not yet been added.

Once all information is provided, the community tag will be removed and it will be ready to use in live environments.

#### Integrating "community components" into the design system

The MoJ Design System team reviews all newly submitted components.

Once we have all the information about the component and the review is finished, the team will look to remove the "<strong>community component</strong>" tag. This means it is ready for use across all phases of an Agile project.

### Suggest a change and provide feedback on community components

To continue improving the MoJ Design System, you can suggest changes to components as well as provide feedback as part of discussions on each component.

To do so, go to the component page and select the link to take you to [the discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions) to share your insights and any research you have available.
