The MoJ Design System is a collaboration between the community of users and the design system team. Anyone can get involved to help improve and grow the design system by:

Anyone can get involved to help improve and grow the design system by:

- adding new components
- providing feedback on components and patterns
- getting involved in the community discussions

### Adding new components

All new components submitted to the design system must include specific information before being published.

#### Minimum criteria for adding a new component to the design system
When adding a new component, you need to include information explaining:

- what the component is
- when and when not to use it
- how to use it
- details of how it has been tested for accessibility

#### Criteria for a "complete" component

If you also have the following information available, this helps bring the component to a more complete state:

- the component design in the MoJ Figma Kit
- HTML/Nunjucks code
- full documentation to support all aspects of the component

#### After submitting the new component

It will be available to view immediately in the design system. All new components added by community users are tagged as "<strong>community components</strong>".

This means they're only intended for use in the alpha and beta phases of the project. As these are components submitted by the community, they're not for use in a live environment until integrated into the design system.

#### Integrating "community components" into the design system

The MoJ Design System team reviews all newly submitted components.

Once we have all the information about the component and the review is finished, the team will look to remove the "<strong>community component</strong>" tag. This means it is ready for use across all phases of an Agile project.

### Suggest a change and provide feedback on community components

To continue improving the MoJ Design System, you can suggest changes to components as well as provide feedback as part of discussions on each component.

To do so, go to the component page and select the link to take you to [the discussion on GitHub]() to share your insights and any research you have available.
