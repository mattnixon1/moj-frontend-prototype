To help improve the MoJ Design System, you can suggest changes to components and patterns.

The team wants to hear suggestions that may include:
- how you have used components and patterns in your service
- research or testing that can help improve an existing component or pattern
- reporting bugs where you've used a component or pattern in a live service and noticed an issue
- any feedback you have about usage, for example accessibility or ideas for improvements
